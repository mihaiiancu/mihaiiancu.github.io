It took me some time to start blogging. After so many searches on other people's blogs, leeching the accumulated knowledge freely shared by others, it is time to give back.
A friend of mine kinda dared me when I suggested she would make a wonderful blogger: she will start one if I did it first. So here I am with a typical developer "Hello World" post.

Although not new to pages and github documentation in Markdown, first time using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
Followed the very good guide written by Jonathan McGlone: [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) and ended up being very easy.

Next, will have to install Jekyll locally and think of an interesting or educational post.
